## Moving Air

While Mighty Ocean winds aid waves in their roll,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the delicate sea breeze playfully tickles the soul.
While caressing the skin as it wanders its way,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It caresses within, blessing with beauty a beautiful day.

## Discussion

It's no surprise I wrote this one while at the beach! I was invited to go to Destin during spring break 2003 with my best friend Zach and his family. I wrote a few poems while I was there including this one.

There's nothing quite like the ocean waves and winds. They demonstrate an infinite and eternal power, while also being fickle and ephemeral. It seems impossible to experience the ocean and not feel like you are in touch with something deep, profound, and powerful. The ocean speaks to us, always the same, but never repeating, in a language both unknown and universally understood.
