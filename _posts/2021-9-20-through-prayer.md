## Through Prayer

I was heading back to Knoxville,  
With a sickness that’s really real.  
Food didn’t solve the hunger; Imagination only helped.  
It seemed nothing could fulfill, the need I truly felt.  

I need you  
My whole life through  
To be close to me  
Spiritually.  
Though miles away you were right there  
Through our Lord above, through prayer.

But God was there  
He’s everywhere  
And he reminded me that you’re here with me.  
I felt you praying  
And I hear you saying  
That you love me  
Unconditionally.

I need you  
My whole life through  
To be close to me  
Spiritually.  
Though miles away you were right there  
Through our Lord above, through prayer.

All through the day and into the night  
I think of you as my guiding light.  
Without you I’m a shadow without purpose, without life.  
The glimmer of your heavenly love lifted all my worries and strife.  
I’m half without you, you’re just half without me,  
But together we can serve his Majesty.

I need you  
My whole life through  
To be close to me  
Spiritually.  
Though miles away you were right there  
Through our Lord above, through prayer.

I want to hear your voice, or play with your hand—  
Just go on a trip that hasn’t been planned.  
And sit on the grass enjoying the breeze,  
Holding your hand with a gentle squeeze.  

I need you  
My whole life through  
To be close to me  
Spiritually.  
Though miles away you were right there  
Through our Lord above, through prayer.

The one thing that’ll always be true,  
Always and forever, I love you.

## Discussion

This was a love poem written for Alysia. The structure is similar to a song with a repeating chorus. I think this was written after visiting her when on the way back home. I would've been around 13 years old.
