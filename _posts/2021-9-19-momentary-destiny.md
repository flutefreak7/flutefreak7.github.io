## Through Prayer

You’ve got a choice  
You wouldn’t have this choice if it weren’t for other choices you’ve made  
Choices lead to consequences  
but every consequence leads to another choice  
cause and effect.  
the choice you make now will be your chariot to future choices  
choices give us wings to surmount the past and meet our destiny  
for a moment  
ask yourself, where do you want to be?  
close your eyes ~ look and see  
and fly  
STOP!  
where are you?  
you took a glance, but look beyond the frosting  
You don’t even know if it’s chocolate or vanilla sometimes  
The icing looks so good but it’s only a sliver compared to the cake  
Look at all the experiences your choices lead to  
You’ve got one life here, one string of choices  
yes or no?  
God’s telling you  
he gave us our needs and our wants  
he knows how to quench that thirst  
you say he’s in your heart, so feel him out  
our experiences define our life  
choices define experiences  
choices define those choices  
and feelings define the original choices  
your answer is in how you feel—where your passions are  
You’ve got a love inside you  
find your love not someone else’s  
the answer is in you, nothing else  
chocolate or vanilla,  
You’ve got a choice


## Discussion

All I remember is that this was written for my friend Marianne when she was facing a difficult decision.
