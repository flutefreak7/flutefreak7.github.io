not that way  
a spectrum?  
spectrum of love?  
or  
a category?

of different degree  
or different kind

well  
never mind  
whatever

Never?

pain  
unrelenting pain  
afterwards  
after the joy  
the romance  
after the “love”  
the like  
the crush  
the friendship  
pain  
but,

Pain is always  
always for this time  
until after time  
then?  
but,  
what about me?

greater frequency?  
different type?  
a new beast altogether?  
show me  
teach me  
whatwherewhenhowwhowhy?  
?  
but,  



## Discussion

This poem is attempts to capture the stream of conciousness thought process that plagued my high school mind and heart when trying to unravel the mysteries of love, its various expressions in different types of relationships, and the tensions it creates. Perhaps the greatest tension I felt at that young age was the fact that my high school relationships were subject to rules, restrictions, and boundaries, while my teenage hormones (the very reason for the aforementioned boundaries) were not. So many of my friendships seemed to have the seed of something more, the added tension of romance, just under the surface. It was maddening to know, objectively, that the purpose of these feelings was to eventually be fulfilled and satisfied in marraige, but that in the meantime, some or all of my desires would remain unrequited, whether I had a "girlfriend" or not. Part of my struggle was related to the Christian condemnation of attraction and lust as being a sin equivalent to fornication or adultry and the shame Christian youths are taught to associate with those feelings. It wasn't just the spiritual consequences that were catastrophized, but the earthly consequences as well. If you break the rules and give way to lust it is the path to the dark side -- where the dark side is babies. So I struggled with the whole concept of love, both rejoicing in the beauty of those I was attracted to while simultaneously condemning myself for being broken and doomed to suffer painful consequences.
