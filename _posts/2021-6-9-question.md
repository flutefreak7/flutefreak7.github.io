## Discussion

I wrote this in high school to future members of the choir and choral ensemble. I posted it on the wall on one of the last days of school as a call to future generations that would come through that room as I had. Music was at the heart of my high school experience and I was sad to leave band and choir behind. As a prominent member and leader in all of my school's music programs, I felt a connection to the younger students coming behind me.

The poem is broken into 4 stanzas, each compelling the audience in turn to sing with all of their voice, mind, heart, and self. Choir for me wasn't about singing with my voice alone and I hoped that others would also put their whole soul into it as I had. The energy in choral ensemble was a rare gift -- being surrounded by people who share a passion and talent and creating magic together that transcended the mere sounds and notes.
