## sucoF etamitnI

I blinked my eyes once or twice,  
Thinking them lies I then blinked thrice  
As I open my eyes  
After three tries I realize,  
A little more, than  
I did before, can  
I understand  
The plans I made–   
I am dismayed  
My plans parade  
My façade they promenade.  
But in the silent unspoken  
An island broken and empty  
I soak in my sympathy  
For me and myself,  
And I find no help  
In my broken, breaking, croaking self.  

So I blink my eyes  
And I search the wide  
And think on why  
My ego doesn’t hide  
Behind my soul,  
Why can’t I control  
My stance, my one goal  
In my romance with Brett,  
with me, I chance,  
to forget to be me  
my identity in  
He, my foundation  
For I, in my elation,  
And also me, in my frustration.  

He does not blink,  
But sees, through my labels  
His view distinct, of Brett Ables,  
This new perspective, strange  
Reflective, at the range  
I marvel of my deranged  
Parts to those parts reclaimed.  
My larval love, arighted, changed  
My butterflying heart crying:  
To think that I cannot  
Achieve my reprieve, but must  
believe, that my lot, it  
Is composed, of trust,  
Not blinking, thinking not  
Eyes closed, I submit  
Quiet. I am taught.



## Discussion

This was my first attempt at a stream of consciousness poem with loose overlapping rhyming and a emphasis on flow. Most of the vowel sounds and rhymes are echoed 3 or more times in overlap with adjacent rhyme / consonance groups.

The poem in broken into 3 stanzas. In the first I am opening my eyes to my own brokenness. In the second I am looking beyond myself for identity in something better than my own plans, in my case, in God. In the 3rd stanza I am seen by the higher power. My problems are laid bare even more clearly than I knew. I realize that I can't fix myself, but must trust and submit to the teaching of a higher authority.

Oh, and the title is "Intimate Focus" backwards. Since the entire poem is essentially a meditation on my backwardness, I thought a backward title that you have to blink at a few times was appropriate. :P
