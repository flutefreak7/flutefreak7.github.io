## The Craving

Hiding, hiding, still residing  
Again I welcome the unwelcome guest  
Riding, riding still abiding  
On this journey I must face the test  
Even on this journey I find no rest.  
<div style="padding-left:20.00em;">With this trial, I am blessed</div>

Longing, longing, for those I am wronging  
Loving wrongly those I love best  
Belonging, belonging, to my desires prolonging  
The passion that burns within my chest  
That burning passion that I now detest  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this passion, I am blessed

Yearning, yearning, hormones churning  
With discerning I see my heart possessed  
Yearning, yearning, heavenward turning  
Possess my soul while I am stressed  
Lord free my soul as I am oppressed  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this hope, I am blessed

Glowing, glowing, I smile in knowing  
In your white garment I am dressed  
Glowing, glowing, your love is flowing  
Growing in faith, I repented, confessed  
In faith I am off, in Your love caressed  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In your love, I am blessed
